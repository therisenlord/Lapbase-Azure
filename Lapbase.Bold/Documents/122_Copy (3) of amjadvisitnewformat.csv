john,erts,12/01/1950,19/01/1950,0,100.9090909,167.64,Fisher,Julie," The patient is doing well. Blood work was reviewed. Normal CBC and CMP. Drain output is very small but has green color. I am concerned about the possibility of a small leak. However she does not have fever or abdominal pain. In fact she looks very good. So I have decided to leave the drain in for now. She will return in one week with repeat blood work for drain removal. If the color stays green by her appointment, she will call and move her appointment down by one more week. She will call back in case of fever "

apps,rhonda,19/01/1950,4/03/2009,0,222.2727273,181.61,Andrews,Chris," This is a very difficult situation. My original goal for him was 400 lbs. After the hospital got new CT scanner with higher weight limit I revised his target to 440 lbs. I was even willing to proceed if he was 450 lbs or close to that. Unfortunately he has continued to gain weight and now gained 27 lbs. He says he is walking, drinking protein shakes and trying to consume 1900 Kcals a day. He has been off phentermine for 3 days. Someone stole his wallet. He is planning to refill his phentermine. I also gave him a script for topamax 25 mg bid. It will be increased to 50 mg bid next month. Side effects were discussed with him. ABG was reviewed. He is using his BIPAP regularly. He was given a script for physical therapy. He will get his psych evaluation done in June and follow up with us. He will stop by the office for weekly weight check. I have given him a tentatively time frame of October 2015 for his surgery if he is able to get between 450-460 lbs by then. I gave him money for pedometer today and advised him to get it on the way out. "
Eldridge-Phan ,Tina ,19/01/1950,19/01/1950,0,79.09090909,151.13,Fisher,Julie," I had a long discussion with her today. She has a gastrogastric fistula and most of her symptoms are probably due to a large gastrogastric fistula that was seen on upper endoscopy and upper GI study. She is a candidate for revision of gastric bypass. The procedure is complicated and long and has higher risk of complications than first time surgery. Endoscopic revision of the fistula is probably not an option because the fistula is very wide. She wants to proceed with the procedure but wants to wait till the end of summer because of a lot of things going on in her life. Her blood work was reviewed. Zinc level is low. B12 is borderline. She was advised to continue Zinc supplement and take B12 500 microgram once a day. She says B12 makes her hungry. She was advised to try to a lower dose of B12, eg 100 micrograms a day or take a B complex tablet. She was also advised to take Vitamin D3, 2000 units over the counter once a day. She says milk causes diarrhea. She was advised to try lactaid milk."
